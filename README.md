Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The gaming room project was to design a cloud based game that would be available to multiple platforms 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I was able to get the based code completed and able to get the flow charts and proper reserach on operating platforms. 


What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Learning the process from beggning to end helped me understand how the final product is developed. When i joined my current job, the software was already in the final stages of the project. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would like to rework the code. I still feel is my weakest. Going back and anaylize the code and comment ever process. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I took all the inforamtion I need from the user requieremts first and then their nice to have. Work on the main points and get their requirements first and then worked on the rest. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I tried to make everything as easier as possible. Checking every angle possible before deciding what direction to take. What will be cost effective for the client and efficient for me to develop the program
